## Overview

The Unity Audio Visualizer Project transforms audio data into interactive, real-time visualizations. This project supports a variety of audio-reactive elements, including particle effects, dynamic lighting, and shaders, that respond to different frequency bands (bass, mid, high). This allows for a visually compelling experience synced to music of choice.

## Project Structure

### Key Components
- **Scripts**: Handle audio analysis and control visual components.
- **Shaders**: Provide advanced visual effects for real-time audio response.
- **Materials**: Link shaders with GameObjects to create specific visual effects.
- **Audio Source**: Provides the audio input for the entire visualization.

## Scripts

### AudioSpectrum.cs
**Purpose**: Captures and processes audio data from an `AudioSource` to create a spectrum array used by other scripts.

**Key Features**:
- Supports a configurable `spectrumSize` (64 to 8192) to match project needs.
- Populates a static `spectrum` array for easy access by other scripts.
- Uses Unityâ€™s `GetSpectrumData()` to gather frequency data from the audio source.

**Code Behavior**:
- Initializes the `AudioSource` and the `spectrum` array.
- Updates the `spectrum` array each frame, ensuring real-time audio data is available for other components.

### ParticleAudioVisualizer.cs
**Purpose**: Modifies the behavior of a particle system based on the audio spectrum data, adjusting properties like emission rate, size, and color for bass, mid, and high frequencies.

**Key Features**:
- Controls particle emission, color, size, and trail properties.
- Uses `Mathf.Lerp()` for smooth transitions in response to amplitude changes.
- Configurable parameters for emission and amplitude scaling.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- The script references `AudioSpectrum.spectrum` to gather amplitude data.
- Smooths amplitude changes to prevent abrupt visual transitions.
- Adjusts particle and trail color based on the assigned frequency range, creating a differentiated look for each band.

### LightIntensityController.cs
**Purpose**: Dynamically adjusts the intensity of point lights based on high-frequency audio amplitude for additional visual emphasis.

**Key Features**:
- Smoothly interpolates light intensity using `Mathf.Lerp()` for fluid changes.
- Accepts customizable `baseIntensity` and `intensityMultiplier` values.
- Responds to high-frequency amplitudes for impactful visual highlights.

**How It Works**:
- Fetches high-frequency data from `AudioSpectrum.spectrum`.
- Modulates light intensity to sync with high audio peaks, creating a pulsating effect.

### ShaderAudioLink.cs
**Purpose**: Acts as a bridge between the audio data and material properties, allowing shaders to react in real-time to the audio.

**Key Features**:
- Passes processed audio amplitudes (bass, mid, high) as shader properties.
- Scales and clamps amplitude values to ensure consistent and manageable visual effects.

**How It Integrates**:
- Updates shader properties per frame to create real-time audio-linked visual feedback in materials.

### ReactiveSphereController.cs
**Purpose**: Controls the visual behavior of a reactive sphere that rotates, shifts colors, and applies a vortex effect based on audio input.

**Key Features**:
- Rotates the sphere on the Y-axis at a configurable speed.
- Adjusts UV distortion to create a vortex effect that reacts to audio.
- Shifts color along a gradient texture to match audio amplitude changes.

**Visual Impact**:
- The sphere's dynamic color changes and motion provide a background effect that synchronizes with audio, adding depth and movement to the scene.

## Shaders

### BassReactiveParticleShader.shader
**Purpose**: Enhances particles by responding to bass frequency amplitudes, creating low-end visual effects.

### MidReactiveParticleShader.shader
**Purpose**: Reacts to mid-range frequencies, providing particle effects that highlight medium-range audio elements.

### HighReactiveParticleShader.shader
**Purpose**: Responds to high-frequency amplitudes, emphasizing sharper audio peaks with visual changes in particle properties.

### ReactiveSphereShader.shader
**Purpose**: Controls the background sphere's visuals based on audio data, including color modulation, emission, and vortex effects.

**Details**:
- Uses a gradient texture to enable smooth color transitions.
- Applies real-time audio data to modulate emission and UV distortion.

## Materials

### BassParticleMaterial
**Usage**: Paired with `BassReactiveParticleShader` to enhance bass-driven particle effects.

### MidParticleMaterial
**Usage**: Used with `MidReactiveParticleShader` for mid-frequency particle reactions.

### HighParticleMaterial
**Usage**: Applied with `HighReactiveParticleShader` to emphasize high-frequency visuals.

### ReactiveSphereMaterial
**Usage**: Attached to the sphere with `ReactiveSphereShader` for an audio-reactive background that adapts to sound data.

## How to Use This Project
